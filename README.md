# Introduction

  Since we cannot uninstall Microsoft Edge, I wanted to do it by myself. So I wrote this little script (and converted it to an exe too) to do it for me and I wanted to share it on github to help others, so here it is! Hope it we'll be helpfull, I made it really easy.
  
## How to?

  If you want to use the script, just run it as an admin, thats all what it needs! If you run the exe it will ask you all alone !

### How does it works?

  Well, Microsoft Edge and it's components are in the file located at C://Program Files/Microsoft (or C://Program Files (x86)/Microsoft, so, all what my file does is deleting the content of this directory and that's it! At least for now, because windows is constantly evolving and I will search if it will be resinstalled during an update what caused it.
